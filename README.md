# CDNjs Asset Manager

CDNjs asset manager helps you to install, update, manage and test CDNjs assets in your Laravel app. It uses Blade directive to include an appropriate asset in your template, by an alias you define. All assets are stored in database and cached on the first request indefintely.

Front-end of the manager lets you add, edit, update and test assets, fetching them direclty from CDNjs. You can also set up a scheduler to check for (and even autoupdate to) new version of the asset, according to version mask you define.

## Examples

You can add something like this in your blade template or partial:
```html
<html>
<body>
    <head>
        <-- include css assets -->
        @cdnjs(bootstrap-css|select2-css)
    </head>
    
......

    <!-- include js assets -->
    @cdnjs(jquery|bootstrap-js|select2-js)
</body>
</html>
```
And you will get an output like this:
```html
<html>
<body>
    <head>
        <!-- include css assets -->
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/4.0.3/css/select2.min.css" />

    </head>
    
<!-- ... -->

    <!-- include js assets -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/4.0.3/js/select2.min.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

## Installation

Require the package by running in your console:
```
composer require zanozik/cdnjs
composer update
```
Publishing assets and running migration is easy:
```
php artisan package:install
```
This will create `assets` table, seed it with sample data, which is used to render cdnjs Asset manager, as example,
copy `cdnjs.php` config and language files (English, by default), blade templates for your convinience.

## Configuration

Config file consists of routes, url and time options.
You can change them according to your needs, alhtough default setting should also work just fine.

Change to desired time for daily version check and autoupdate (assign `false` if you want to completely disable this feature):
```
	/*
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| Daily version update check time (HH:ss)
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|
	*/
	'time' => '0:00'
```
Route prefix and middleware you want to use:
```
	/*
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| Routes group config
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|
	*/
	'route' => [
		'prefix' => 'cdnjs',
		'middleware' => 'web'
	],
```
Change prefix to whatever you want to appear before the path to you cdnjs Asset Manager.
By default the path is `/cdnjs/assets`, so you can change it to something like, `/admin/assets`
by assigning  `'prefix' => 'admin',`. You can even disable prefix by assigning an empty string
and call the route by `/assets`.

You can add more middlewares by an array, if you need to, like this:
```
	/*
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| Routes group config
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|
	*/
	'route' => [
		'prefix' => 'cdnjs',
		'middleware' => [
		    'web',
		    'auth'
        ],
	],
```
## Usage

Click on *Create new asset* and search for desired library by entering partial keyword in *Library* textbox
on opened modal.

Choose desired version and asset, your custom alias (name) to call from your templates,
default will be autogenerated for you. If you want to use version check, choose *Version check* and *Autoupdate* masks.

*Autoupdate mask* cannot be wider than *Version check mask*.

If a new version is found automatically, according to defined masks, during the version check,
cdnjs Asset Manager will record the version and let you test and update to it.

It will automatically update current version to a new version, if a new version happens to fall under defined *Autoupdate mask*.

The package will also fire predefined `Events`.

## Handling events

The package can fire two events:
* `Events\NewAssetVersion`
* `Events\AssetVersionUpdated`

The package will pass `Asset` collection to each `Event`.

You can listen for and catch these events any way you want (read further on Laravel docs, [Events](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/events)).

#### Example:

Create app/Listeners/NewVersionListener.php
```
<?php

namespace App\Listeners;

class NewVersionListener
{
    /**
     * Create the event listener.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        //
    }

    /**
     * Handle the event.
     *
     * @param  \Zanozik\Cdnjs\Events\NewAssetVersion $event
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle(\Zanozik\Cdnjs\Events\NewAssetVersion $event)
    {
        //$event->asset will return your affected asset
    }
}

```
 You may run `php artisan make:listener NewVersionListener --event="\Zanozik\Cdnjs\Events\NewAssetVersion"`) in your console instead
 (Coming soon... [maybe](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/19660))

And in your app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php register that listener in your `$listen` array:
```
    protected $listen = [
        'Zanozik\Cdnjs\Events\NewAssetVersion' => [
            'App\Listeners\NewVersionListener',
        ],
    ];

```

## Important notes

If you fear you will break cdnjs Asset Manager functionallity by changing default assets, 
override `cdnjs` directive in published `index.blade.php` (override tags has beed preset for you).
